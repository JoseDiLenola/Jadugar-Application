# Jadugar Project Specification

## 1. Project Vision

### 1.1 Purpose
Jadugar is an application lifecycle management platform that helps teams track, monitor, and support their applications from development through production. It follows a staged approach to provide comprehensive application lifecycle support:

Stage 1 - Build Observatory:
- Track application build progress in real-time
- Integrate with development tools and CI/CD
- Provide build analytics and insights
- Support development teams

Stage 2 - Application Lighthouse:
- Monitor production applications
- Track performance and health
- Manage alerts and incidents
- Support operations teams

Future Stage 3 - Application Harbor:
- Full application hosting platform
- Container orchestration
- Automated scaling
- Complete lifecycle management
