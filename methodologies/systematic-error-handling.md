# Systematic Error Handling Methodology (SEHM)

## Overview
This document outlines a comprehensive methodology for handling errors in software systems, combining elements from Toyota's 5 Whys, Root Cause Analysis (RCA), and engineering best practices. The methodology ensures systematic, efficient, and thorough error resolution while building institutional knowledge.

## Core Principles
1. Bottom-up resolution
2. Complete dependency understanding
3. Systematic verification
4. Comprehensive documentation
5. Continuous improvement

## The Formula

### 1. IDENTIFY (Root Cause Discovery)
A = Most fundamental dependency or component
B = Components that depend on A
C = Components that depend on B

**Process:**
- Ask "Why?" at each level until you can't go deeper
- Map all dependencies before starting fixes
- Create a visual dependency graph if complex

### 2. ANALYZE (Impact Assessment)
For each error:
- Is it an A, B, or C issue?
- What components depend on it?
- What components does it depend on?

**Requirements:**
- Document environmental factors
- Identify potential side effects
- List all related subsystems
- Create failure hypothesis

### 3. SEQUENCE (Resolution Order)
Rule: A → B → C (never reverse)
1. Fix A and verify
2. Only then fix B and verify
3. Only then fix C and verify

**Safety Measures:**
- Create rollback points before each fix
- Document alternative approaches considered
- Estimate impact radius of each fix

### 4. VERIFY (Quality Assurance)
After each fix:
- Run core functionality test
- Check for related issues
- Document any non-blocking warnings

**Enhancement Layer:**
- Add regression test suite
- Create verification checklist
- Set up monitoring for similar issues
- Define success criteria before fixing

### 5. DOCUMENT (Knowledge Capture)
Track in order:
- What was the root issue (A)?
- What chain of dependencies was affected?
- What verification steps confirmed the fix?
- What warnings remain for future optimization?

**Future-Proofing:**
- Create prevention strategies
- Document lessons learned
- Update system architecture docs
- Create early warning indicators

## Example Application

### Node.js Version Resolution Case Study

#### 1. IDENTIFY
```
✓ Root cause discovery through Why-chain:
  Why? Package install failing
  Why? Workspace protocol issue
  Why? Node.js version mismatch
✓ Dependency map:
  Node.js → Yarn → Workspace → Packages
```

#### 2. ANALYZE
```
✓ Impact assessment:
  - Development environment
  - CI/CD pipelines
  - Team workflows
✓ Related subsystems:
  - Build process
  - Development tools
  - Package management
```

#### 3. SEQUENCE
```
✓ Resolution steps:
  1. Create system snapshot
  2. Fix Node.js version
  3. Document alternatives:
     - Docker containment
     - NVM aliases
     - Package.json engines
```

#### 4. VERIFY
```
✓ Quality checks:
  - Node version verification
  - CI integration
  - .nvmrc implementation
  - Engine constraints
  - Version monitoring
```

#### 5. DOCUMENT
```
✓ Knowledge capture:
  - Root: Node.js version mismatch
  - Prevention:
    * Version checks
    * Onboarding docs
    * Setup scripts
  - Early warnings:
    * Engine warnings
    * Compatibility checks
```

## Best Practices
1. Always start at the lowest level (A)
2. Never skip verification steps
3. Document everything, including failed attempts
4. Create prevention mechanisms
5. Update team knowledge base

## Maintenance
This methodology should be reviewed and updated quarterly based on:
1. New error patterns discovered
2. Team feedback
3. System architecture changes
4. New tools and practices
5. Lessons learned from applications
