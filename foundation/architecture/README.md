# Jadugar Core Interfaces

This documentation covers all core interfaces in the Jadugar project. Each interface is thoroughly documented with examples, use cases, and implementation guidelines.

   - IBaseService
   - IEntity
   - IEventEmitter
   - IPlugin

2. [Validation Interfaces](./validation/README.md)
   - IValidator
   - ISchemaValidator
   - IHipaaValidator
   - ITenantValidator
   - IOfflineValidator
   - ICompositeValidator

3. [Data Layer Interfaces](./data/README.md)
   - IDataStore
   - IOfflineStore
   - IHipaaStore
   - ITenantStore

4. [Service Layer Interfaces](./services/README.md)
   âœ… Complete (Phase 1)
   - Security Services
   - Cache Services
   - Event Services
   - Logging Services
   - Metrics Services

## Architecture Overview

The Jadugar interface system is built on several key principles:

1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Each interface has a single, well-defined responsibility
   - Interfaces are grouped by domain (base, validation, data, services)
   - Clear boundaries between different layers

2. **Extensibility**
   - Base interfaces provide extension points
   - Plugin system for adding new functionality
   - Composite pattern for combining behaviors

3. **Security First**
   - HIPAA compliance built into core interfaces
   - Multi-tenant support at interface level
   - Audit logging and access control

4. **Offline Support**
   - Offline-first design patterns
   - Sync mechanisms built into interfaces
   - Conflict resolution strategies

5. **Performance**
   - Async operations throughout
   - Caching interfaces
   - Batch operation support

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Error Handling**
   - Use typed errors
   - Include error context
   - Support error recovery

2. **Async Operations**
   - Promise-based APIs
   - Support for cancellation
   - Progress reporting

3. **Type Safety**
   - Generic type parameters
   - Strong typing
   - Runtime type checking

4. **Testing**
   - Interface compliance tests
   - Mock implementations
   - Performance benchmarks

## Service Layer Implementations
All service interfaces have corresponding implementations:

### Security Services
- `AuthenticationService`: MFA and session management
- `AuthorizationService`: Role-based access control
- `HipaaSecurity`: PHI encryption and compliance
- `AuditService`: Comprehensive audit logging

### Cache Services
- `CacheService`: TTL and tag support
- `DistributedCache`: Distributed locking and pub/sub

### Event Services
- `EventService`: Event management
- `DistributedEventService`: Distributed processing

### Logging Services
- `LoggingService`: Structured logging
- `StructuredLogger`: JSON logging with querying

### Metrics Services
- `MetricsService`: Metrics collection
- `RealTimeMetrics`: Real-time monitoring

## Implementation Notes
- All services follow SOLID principles
- Comprehensive error handling
- Async/await throughout
- HIPAA compliance built-in
- Distributed system support
- Real-time monitoring

## Next Steps
- Integration testing
- Performance optimization
- Security audits
