# Foundation Documentation

This directory contains the core foundational documentation for Jadugar, establishing the fundamental principles, architecture, and design patterns.

## Directory Structure

### Architecture
- [`architecture/`](architecture/): System architecture and design decisions
  - [`system-design.md`](architecture/system-design.md): Overall system architecture
  - [`data-flow.md`](architecture/data-flow.md): Data flow patterns
  - [`integration-patterns.md`](architecture/integration-patterns.md): Integration patterns
  - [`decisions/`](architecture/decisions/): Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

### Principles
- [`principles/`](principles/): Core engineering principles
  - [`engineering-principles.md`](principles/engineering-principles.md): Core engineering principles
  - [`coding-standards.md`](principles/coding-standards.md): Coding standards
  - [`security-principles.md`](principles/security-principles.md): Security principles

### Design
- [`design/`](design/): Design patterns and conventions
  - [`patterns.md`](design/patterns.md): Common design patterns
  - [`conventions.md`](design/conventions.md): Design conventions

## Key Concepts

1. **Architecture First**
   - All design decisions must align with architecture
   - Changes must be documented in ADRs
   - Follow established patterns

2. **Engineering Principles**
   - Follow coding standards
   - Maintain consistency
   - Ensure security

3. **Design Standards**
   - Use approved patterns
   - Follow conventions
   - Document deviations
